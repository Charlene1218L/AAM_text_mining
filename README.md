## 📖 Abstract  
Advanced air mobility (AAM) has garnered escalating attention from academia, government, business, and the general public. Previous studies tended to investigate these main stakeholders separately, failing to identify their various attentions, attitudes and focus areas. This research employs bibliometric and social media text mining methods to investigate perspectives of stakeholders on AAM from 2015 to 2024, with over 450,000 texts in total. The findings reveal a consistent rise in text volume across all stakeholders, with general public demonstrating the fastest growth rate. Globally, the text sentiment is predominantly positive or neutral, with negative sentiment being the least prevalent. The topic analysis reveals stakeholders have heterogeneous priorities, with businesses and governments emphasizing AAM-related infrastructure, general public focusing on end-user experiences, and academia concentrating on aerodynamics and safety concerns. This research seeks to inform actionable formulation and air-transport planning, thereby facilitating AAM integration into urban and regional transportation systems.
